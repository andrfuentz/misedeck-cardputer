- M5Stack Cardputer ADV / Cardputer-Adv

The firmware uses the ESP32-S3 / StampS3 target used by the Cardputer.

## Controls

- `;` â€” up
- `.` â€” down
- `,` â€” left / previous
- `/` â€” right / next

During text or number editing:

- `,` â€” move cursor left
- `/` â€” move cursor right
- `Del` â€” delete before cursor

## Local browser portal

After connecting the Cardputer to Wi-Fi:

1. Open `http://misedeck.local` in a browser, or use the IP shown on the Cardputer.
2. Browse recipes by category or the All tab.
3. Open a recipe to view, scale, edit TXT, save changes, or download it.

The portal runs directly from the Cardputer on your local network. It is not a cloud service and does not require an account.

## Recipe TXT format

Mise_Deck uses a simple, human-readable TXT format:

```txt
FOCACCIA DO ANDRE
CATEGORY: DOUGHS
FAVORITE: YES
TOTAL: 700.3

[INGREDIENTS]

WATER|293.0|g
SUGAR|8.0|g
OLIVE OIL|20.0|g
WHEAT FLOUR|366.0|g
YEAST|3.3|g
SALT|10.0|g
```

Composite recipes use `[PREP]` blocks.

## Offline sharing

Mise_Deck can generate an offline sharing QR code:

```text
Recipe > Actions > Share
```

The QR code does not require your home Wi-Fi. It helps a phone connect directly to the Cardputer sharing mode and open a local recipe page with copy/download options.
