# Mise_Deck

**A pocket mise en place and kitchen utility firmware for the M5Stack Cardputer.**

Mise_Deck turns the M5Stack Cardputer into a small kitchen companion for recipe scaling, ingredient management, timers, offline sharing, and local browser access.

> *"we are the music makers and we are the dreamers of dreams"*

Mise_Deck was idealized by **André Fuentes** / **@anfuentz** and vibecoded with **Codex**.

## Current release

**v1.5.0** - English and Portuguese/Brazilian firmware builds are provided.

## Interface preview

### Main menu

The Cardputer interface is designed around a simple amber terminal/cyberdeck style, with large menu targets and persistent navigation hints.

Recipe viewing was redesigned for the small Cardputer screen: ingredients and preps are shown one at a time with large, readable weights.

### Wi-Fi and local portal

After connecting to Wi-Fi, the Cardputer serves a local browser portal at `misedeck.local` or the IP shown on screen.

## Browser portal

The browser portal is designed for phone and desktop use. It runs directly from the Cardputer on your local network; it is not a cloud service and does not require an account.

### Desktop overview

Browse recipes by category, open recipes, download TXT files, create new recipes, sync, and access backup options.

### Mobile recipe library

The portal layout adapts to phones with stacked actions, horizontal category tabs, and larger touch targets.

### Guided browser editor

Create and edit recipes through guided fields instead of raw text. Inputs normalize recipe data to uppercase for consistency.

### Backup export

The backup menu offers full-library TXT export or individual recipe TXT files packed into a ZIP.

- `.` - down
- `,` - left / previous
- `/` - right / next
- `OK` / `Enter` - confirm

## Recipe TXT format

Mise_Deck uses a simple, human-readable TXT format:

```txt
FOCACCIA DO ANDRE
CATEGORY: DOUGHS
FAVORITE: YES
TOTAL: 700.3

[INGREDIENTS]

WATER|293.0|g
SUGAR|8.0|g
OLIVE OIL|20.0|g
WHEAT FLOUR|366.0|g
YEAST|3.3|g
SALT|10.0|g
```

Composite recipes use `[PREP]` blocks.

## Offline sharing

Mise_Deck can start an offline recipe sharing flow:

```text
Recipe > Actions > Share
```

The QR code does not require your home Wi-Fi. It helps a phone connect directly to the Cardputer sharing mode and open a local recipe page with copy/download options.
