## Local browser portal

After connecting the Cardputer to Wi-Fi:

1. Open `http://cyberchef.local` in a browser, or use the IP shown on the Cardputer.
2. Browse recipes by category or the All tab.
3. Open a recipe to view, scale, edit TXT, save changes, or download it.

The portal runs directly from the Cardputer on your local network. It is not a cloud service and does not require an account.

## Recipe TXT format

Cyber Chef uses a simple, human-readable TXT format:

```txt
FOCACCIA DO ANDRE
CATEGORY: PASTA
FAVORITE: YES
TOTAL: 700.3

[INGREDIENTS]

WATER|293.0|g
SUGAR|8.0|g
OLIVE OIL|20.0|g
WHEAT FLOUR|366.0|g
YEAST|3.3|g
SALT|10.0|g
```

Composite recipes use `[PREP]` blocks.

## Offline sharing

Cyber Chef can generate a QR code with a compact recipe summary:

```text
Recipe > Actions > Share
```

The QR code does not require Wi-Fi. It contains the recipe name, total weight, and ingredient list in plain text.
